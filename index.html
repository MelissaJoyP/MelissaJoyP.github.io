        <p>
            Sculpting with clay is a great way to create a model of a creature, idea, person, or thing.
        </p>
        <p id="why">
            You can sculpt to work out an idea for a product, or to create artwork, or to simply relax.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sculpting is fun for all ages and skill levels!

            Are you ready to start sculpting? <span id="prepare">First, prepare your workspace.</span> Clean off a desk or table. Protect the surface with a mat or parchment paper. Next, gather your supplies. You'll need some oven bake clay. Sculpting tools are optional. Paints bring possibilities. Your imagination is a necessity.
